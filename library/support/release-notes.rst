Detailed release notes have been moved and can be found at

Product Lifecycle
-----------------
Due to the introduction of #SNMP Pro products, the support lifecycle will match
the corresponding Pro products.

#SNMP Pro current release (1.2.0) requires #SNMP Library 9.0.5 and above, so
release 9.0.5 and above are all supported.

Any release older than 9.0.5 is obsolete and no longer supported.

Please visit `#SNMP Pro page <https://pro.sharpsnmp.com/support/release-notes.html>`_ to learn more.
